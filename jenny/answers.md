#### 0 - whats is DOM? and your structure?

<br/>
<p>

    
DOM or Document Object Model is a standardized web interface that allows scripts to dynamically manipulate the content of a web page without the need to perform updates and, currently, it is already built-in in most browsers by default, programmers have access to the simplest part of the DOM but even so it has gaps and that is why front end libraries and frameworks are used as a second layer of security so that the project obtains its best performance, an example of libraries is JQuery which is about a javascript library or the use of pure javascript also called vanilla JS.
The DOM has a structure similar to a "tree" with "branches" for easy manipulation.

#### 3 - report results the following operations
-  4 / 3 * 2 + 20 - 2 * 4 
<br/>
Result: 14.6666666667
<br/> 
-  20 * 4 / 3 + 2
<br/>
Result: 28.6666666667
<br/>
Report:the order to perform the operations is parentheses, powers, multiplications and divisions and addition and subtraction.
With that in mind, all that remains is to do the above operations in the right order, which guarantees the right result.
<br/>

#### 4 -  report results the following logics operations with true or false

- (((X - 1) >= 3) || (Y > 0)) && ((Y - Z) < 0)  
Result: false
- (2 * ( X * X ) > (Z * Y)) && (true === "FALSE")
Result: true
